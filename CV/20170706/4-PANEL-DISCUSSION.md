## PANEL DISCUSSION

### Moderator: For a PhD student in CV today, how to choose problem or approach to work on?

### Moderator: How is research different in the internet-era today?

### Moderator: How to do cutting-edge research in India?

### Moderator: What advantages does India have?

### Gaurav Sharma, IIT Kanpur
- Trivial solution: If you already like a problem, no issues
- If only generally interested: scan conferences, pick a pile of papers, shortlist some topics
- How about finding a problem which hasn’t been solved yet? Discuss with advisor.

### Karteek Alahari
- Most important: the problem has to speak to you, YOU need to be interested in it
- Advantage with CV: many problems to choose from
- There are several textual resources, many visionaries and big names give talks in Key Notes, etc., so ideas are available everywhere

### Qualcomm
- Probably IIIT-H is awesome
- Go for problems that have real-world value
- Look at solutions in non-CV areas
- If there is no other way one can solve from a non-CV formulation, then only go for a CV-based solution

### Moderator: Is research a race now?

### Karteek Alahari
- It is a race, but every person has the potential to produce their own solution to any problem, so there is potential to produce a variety of solutions

### Gaurav
- Yes, it is a race, but it is an advantage
- It is a personal choice
- Go to conferences, talk to people

### Moderator
- Karthik is right, problem should speak to you
- But, how do you approach it? So many advances so fast
- One needs to keep up with the advances
- An individual just starting might not get the nuances that a Research Group has learnt
- The tricks of the trade matter
- Don’t believe everything in a paper, not that they are lying
- Use the internet, email the authors, etc. if you find discrepancies with theory in paper and implementation

### Narendra Ahuja - UIUC, ITRA
- A tuning fork resonates at a certain frequency, a nearby utensil will also. Society will prosper if its citizens are attuned to its problems
- Whole day, we deal with problems - diseases, environment, etc.
- If we are attuned to these problems, and we have empathy, it is natural to want to solve these problems
- Many people have many talents. Whatever springs up in you in trying to solve this problem using your own talents is automatically good for the society
- Approach is subservient to the problem
- Internet - we are much more capable of solving problems now. We don’t have to struggle for data, Data is pouring in, there’s IoT, etc.
- There’s no way what you do is not cutting-edge
- Solve a problem within your own bubble, it’s ok
- Advantage in India - plenty of problems!
- Power, doability are not issues, attune yourself
- Institutions (like IIIT-H) need to bring people back to life, not just worry about next job, next car, etc.

### Moderator: But, like, Autonomous driving, India is the wrong place to start, right? How to balance extra-challenging problems outside of the society, vs problems that need to be solved right now?

### Narendra
- Who is asking you to solve autonomous driving?
- All of us can agree that we don’t need to pick only from the top of the pile

### Qualcomm
- Agreed, plenty of data, plenty of problems to solve
- Changes: more grants, etc
- More importantly, you can build on other people’s work. You can solve one problem, and there’ll be a completely different group that can take it forward

### Moderator: advantage of India?

### Karteek
- Biggest advantage with India: people people people!
- We need annotations for fully supervised, lots of people to get into research, to help out

### Gaurav
- Agree with Narendra about local Indian problems
- Disadvantage with India: we are not making products
- In US, little contractors who collaborate with institutions and act as middlemen for industry. That is a challenge here.
- To get into ground zero of research is difficult here
- Advantage: lot of people

### Moderator: Internet era?

### Gaurav
- Personally, stressful. Things come up very fast. Start with a problem, in 6 months arXiv has a paper.
- But there are only a few groups doing this. Because there is so much info, you can predict where their next paper is going to be.

### Audience: Did you tackle a domain shift due to deep learning? For e.g., a 4th year PhD guy realized all his past work was worthless because deep learning can solve so much?

### Moderator: You’re talking about 4th year PhDs, what about faculty??

### Qualcomm
- You’re learning to dig a hole.
- It is guaranteed that what you’re working on today is not what you’re going to work on 20 years from now
- I’ve changed areas 4 times already

### Gaurav
- Advice: get used to it.
- Adaptability is key

### Moderator: yeah, keep changing

### Audience: India has so many people, next ImageNet? Can we use the people?

### Gaurav
- You pay them.
- Also, you give specific instructions
- VGG-Face dataset was annotated in Hyderabad.

### Karteek
- There has to be some sort of reward
- There has to be a coordinator

### Qualcomm
- Maybe crowdsource it?

### Gaurav
- Datasets are very planned, done by professionals, not students (not to discourage you)

### Audience: 

### Gaurav
- The tricks of the trade need to be picked up
- You have to push through

### Moderator: Take help from other groups

### Karteek
- Collaboration is key

### Audience: As a PhD student, how to balance about low-level (code, etc.) and high-level (work in a larger picture) details simultaneously? Also, does the distribution of time change?

### Karteek
- Yes, time distribution does change
- It’s not always trivial to strike this balance, there will be times when you get bogged down
- Keep talking to your advisor
- Rely on others for help

### Qualcomm
- IP landscaping - first piece in investment

### Gaurav
- Time distribution changing is natural
- People will observe that
- Important to keep yourself motivated

### Moderator
- 1) Advisor gives problem and solution, do; 2) Advisor gives problem, solve; 3) Figure out problem and solution

### Audience: What if someone makes a better method just before you were about to submit your paper?

### Gaurav
- If only I had a penny for every time that happened

### Karteek
- Don’t compare with arXiv, arXiv is not an accepted paper
- Always, there will be some difference between your paper and theirs

### Jawahar
- Be happy that happened because great minds think alike

### Gaurav
- 3 aspects of any paper - new problem, new solution, new perspective
- Try digging into that

### Audience: Deep learning solves everything. So..??

### Karteek
- There’s still a lot to be done.
- Constraints, Weak supervision, …
- There is a lot of scope, we can do a lot more

### Gaurav
- Same abstract answer
- Branch out, try to figure out the next steps

### Audience: Metric to compare PhD students

### Karteek
- Similar to comparing people for any job
- “What is the contribution you have made to solving any problem?”
- Can it stand the test of time?
- CV 10-year award; maybe it’s not something we can evaluate today, but maybe some years down the line
### Moderator
- Readiness to go forward is the real measure. How to go about that is a question though...
- Erstwhile awesome papers now are nowhere close to winning 10-years awards

### Gaurav
- Can’t compare people, can compare papers
- France prefers mathematics, America prefers ideas

### Audience: What if you’re stuck during your PhD?

### Karteek
- There’s so much scope

### Gaurav
- If you’re feeling stuck, go broad

### Moderator
- PhD is not about finding a solution, it is about exploring the landscape of the problem
- That is the way to go about a PhD

### Random Qualcomm guy
- You don’t have to be first to make an impact (Qualcomm < Intel, Google < Yahoo)
- Adaptability - it’s not  a zero-sum game
- Like Karteek said, the problem should speak to you

### Audience: What about a recent B.Tech.? How to choose what?

### Moderator
- Your heart

### Gaurav
- Something you liked - your senior worked on it, you read something, something clicks

### Moderator
- Like Prof. Ahuja said, some problem you yourself feel like solving, not just for money
- It’s not about the actual subject, it’s the skills you pick up on the way
